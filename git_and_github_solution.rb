# What questions do you have about what we've learned so far using git and github?:

# I'm still a bit shaky on working with git, and I'm not sure if I was supposed to clone this file from the remote location on GitHub and then open it through the command line, but I guess I'll find out. The process of using git init, add, commit, log, status, etc. has definitely become more comfortable in the past few days, but I still feel it'll be awhile before I'm comfortable.
